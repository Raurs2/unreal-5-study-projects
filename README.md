# Unreal 5 Study Projects
Some small projects I made while watching tutorials from Unreal Sensei and freeCodeCamp.org allowed me to gain an overview of Unreal Engine's workings, such as basic hotkeys and editor functions, landscape modeling, material nodes, master and instance materials, some C++ classes, foliage, and core Unreal concepts (actors, blueprints, components, events, etc.).
